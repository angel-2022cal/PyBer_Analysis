The second week as a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. The first big project: analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of  2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V.Isualize.

This project is assigned to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sahring services and determine affordability for understanding neighborhoods. 

This project will use the Python graphing library MatPlotlib, which is a favorite tool amng data scientists and data analysts because of its robust visulization features.
