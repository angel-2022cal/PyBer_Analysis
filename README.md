This project will use the Python graphing library MatPlotlib, which is a favorite tool amng data scientists and data analysts because of its robust visulization features. 

## Overview of project

2. Merge your DataFrames
3. Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers of each city type, including urban, suburbanm and rural.
